Intro to Algorithms
===================

This repo is a collection of problem sets and other work associated with my general studying of Algorithms. I've long been told I should read Intro to Algorithms (Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein), but I've never been able to really dig into it. I've decided to record my work here.

I'm going to try to use a variety of programming languages for the problems I solve, so I can use this also as an opportunity to branch out and try new things.
